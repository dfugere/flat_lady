Most information regarding FlatLady is on the "Github Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/thoughtbot/clearance.

h2. Engine

FlatLady is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than 2.3.
   

install the plugin the gem:
  
  ruby script/plugins install ..
     

Make sure the development database exists and run the generator:

    script/generate flat_lady

A number of files will be created and instructions will be printed.

You may already have some of these files. Don't worry. You'll be asked if you want to overwrite them.

Run the migration:

 rake db:migrate

h2. Generate Imported Models

h2. Cucumber Features

As your app evolves, you want to know that authentication still works. FlatLady's opinion is that you should test its integration with your app using "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/.

In config/environments/test.rb:

    config.gem 'webrat',
      :version => '= 0.4.4'
    config.gem 'cucumber',
      :version => '= 0.3.0'
    config.gem 'thoughtbot-factory_girl',
      :lib     => 'factory_girl',
      :source  => "http://gems.github.com", 
      :version => '1.2.1'

Vendor the gems:

    rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
    rake gems:unpack  RAILS_ENV=test

Don't vendor nokogiri (due to its native extensions):

    rm -rf vendor/gems/nokogiri-1.2.3

Run the Cucumber generator (if you haven't already) and FlatLady's feature generator:

    script/generate cucumber
    script/generate flat_lady_features

All of the files generated should be new with the exception of the features/support/paths.rb file. If you have not modified your paths.rb then you will be okay to replace it with this one. If you need to keep your paths.rb file then add these locations in your paths.rb manually:

    def path_to(page_name)
      case page_name
       ...
      when /the sign up page/i
       new_user_path
      when /the sign in page/i
       new_session_path	
      when /the password reset request page/i
       new_password_path
      ...
    end
